# Delivery Solutions Development Organization

Welcome to the Delivery Solutions Development Organization! We are dedicated to creating innovative solutions for managing and optimizing delivery operations, with a primary focus on developing a comprehensive platform for tracking courier deliveries via both mobile and web interfaces.

## About Us

Delivery Solutions Development Organization is committed to revolutionizing the way delivery services are managed and operated. Our team consists of talented developers, designers, and project managers who collaborate to build robust, user-friendly applications tailored to the needs of courier companies and delivery service providers.

## Our Project

Our flagship project is the development of a versatile platform designed to streamline and enhance the delivery process for motoboys (motorcycle couriers) and their dispatchers. This platform will feature:

- **Mobile App**: A mobile application that enables motoboys to receive delivery orders, navigate routes, and update delivery statuses on-the-go using their smartphones.
  
- **Web Portal**: A web-based dashboard for dispatchers and administrators to manage delivery orders, track motoboys' locations in real-time, generate reports, and optimize delivery routes efficiently.

## Repository Structure

This organization hosts multiple repositories dedicated to different components of our delivery solutions platform:

- **[Backend]([link-to-backend-repo](https://github.com/Seven-Howls/delivery-control-backend))**: Contains the server-side code responsible for handling requests, managing data, and facilitating communication between the mobile app, web portal, and external services.
  
- **[Mobile App]([link-to-mobile-repo](https://github.com/Seven-Howls/delivery-control-mobile))**: Holds the codebase for the mobile application, built using [framework/library]. This includes UI components, navigation logic, and integration with device features.
  
- **[Web Portal]([link-to-web-repo](https://github.com/Seven-Howls/delivery-control-web))**: Houses the codebase for the web-based dashboard accessible to dispatchers and administrators. It includes front-end components, backend API integrations, and data visualization tools.
